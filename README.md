## The Next Blockbuster - Web API Project Progression (Prototype)

This repository holds the beginning and endings of a Movie Database Web API project developed during the Spring semester of 2023 at the University of Colorado Denver.

The code contained within each folder was originally structured by the instructor Shawn McCarthy, the role of the student throughout the semester was to provide updates to the existing code bases to implement different requests based off of the provided examples. It is primarily structured around *Node.js* and the *npm* package

- Link to deployed front-end Render website: https://csci3916-hilfer-assignment5.onrender.com/#/

### ðŸ“‚ [Assignment 1 Folder](https://github.com/GrowingPaigns/Web-API-Project-Progression/tree/main/Assignment%201)

This directory holds the bare-bones beginning of where the work for the semester started. It is only useable as a postman project, and even then, that may be questionable 
- I haven't personally tested the postman tests for this version of the project since the date of submission. I thereby dont know if this version of the assignment is still operational

### ðŸ“‚ [Assignment 5 Folder](https://github.com/GrowingPaigns/Web-API-Project-Progression/tree/main/Assignment%205) 

This directory holds the end product of this semester's worth of homework assignments.
- The folder contains front and back-end directories for observers of this page to personally look over the code. However, these are not the actual project directories.
    - The link at the top of this assignment directs you to the Render site hosting my actual front-end repository 
    - The actual back-end repository and the database are of course both hidden to prevent issues
        - But the back-end is likewise hosted on render, while the DB relies on MongoDB Atlas hosting services
